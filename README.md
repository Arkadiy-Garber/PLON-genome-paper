# PLON-genome-paper
Python scripts and files used in the analysis of P. longispinus endosymbionts.
Due to limits in how much data can be uploaded here, there are only a few files used in the analyses present in this repository: raw assembly of endosymbiont genomes, output from (SprayNPray) [https://github.com/Arkadiy-Garber/SprayNPray], and an assembly graph.

Most of the files indicated within the Python scripts can be found by following the the following figshare links:
